## Metadata extraction tool

To make it easier for researchers to use our maMSPs metadata schema, we are working on tools to automate the metadata extraction from code repositories.

We have started with metadata extraction from GitHub and plan to extend it to GitLab. Our metadata extraction tool can be programatically used thanks to its API, but also via an end-user interface. We do not have a live website yet but we are working on it. By now, you can use the [code](https://github.com/zbmed-semtec/maSMP-metadata-extraction), the [pre-beta release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14918499), or the [Docker container](https://github.com/zbmed-semtec/maSMP-metadata-extraction).
