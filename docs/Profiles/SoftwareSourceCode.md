A maintainer is a <a href='https://schema.org/Person' target='_blank'>Person</a> or <a href='https://schema.org/Organization' target='_blank'>Organization</a> that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When <a href='https://schema.org/maintainer' target='_blank'>maintainer</a> is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a <a href='https://schema.org/Dataset' target='_blank'>Dataset</a>, it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The <a href='https://schema.org/isBasedOn' target='_blank'>isBasedOn</a> property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.\n      </td> <td>many</td></tr>
