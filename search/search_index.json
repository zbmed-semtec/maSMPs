Similar to DMPs, SMPs help formalize a set of structures and goals that ensure the software is accessible and reusable in the short, medium and long term. Although targeting the life sciences community, most of the elements of the ELIXIR SMPs are domain agnostic and could be used by other communities as well. DMPs and SMPs can be presented as text-based documents, sometimes guided by a set of questions corresponding to key points related to the lifecycle of either data or software. The RDA DMP Common Standards working group defined a maDMP to overcome limitations of text-based documents. We propose a similar path for the ELIXIR SMPs so they turn into machine-actionable SMPs (maSMPs).</p> <p>Additional Information available at our GitHub repository.</p> <p>Ontology releases are available at DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7806638 while usage guidance (aka profiles, e.g., minimum, recommended and optional properties with cardinality) at DOI:10.5281/zenodo.10582120. The current release corresponds to vr.2.1.0 for types and properties and to vr2.1.1 for profiles. This release includes four types: OuputManagementPlan, SoftwareManagementPlan, SoftwareRunAction and SoftwareTestAction, and additional properties for schema:CreativeWork, schema:SoftwareApplication and schema:SoftwareSourceCode. Profiles are provided for: SoftwareManagementPlan, SoftwareRunAction, SoftwareTestAction, schema:SoftwareApplication and schema:SoftwareSourceCode.

While the source code reflects the current status of a software and can be continuously changing, a software release corresponds to a frozen copy of a particular version. As the source code evolves, shared elements can differ, e.g., new authors can get involved. This changing nature of source code together with the release cycle are important aspects captured by the maSMPs that otherwise might not be evident in text-based questionnaires.
